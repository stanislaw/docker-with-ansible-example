# Example of building a Docker image with Ansible

This example code is inspired by this article:
[Docker without Dockerfiles](https://tech.labs.oliverwyman.com/blog/2019/08/30/docker-without-dockerfiles).

## Running

```
ansible-playbook master-playbook.yaml
```

The actual image playbook can be found in `3-docker-playbook.yaml`.
